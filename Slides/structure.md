# Content breakdown

# Part 1

# 1.1 30 minutes

* Models the brain
* Spatial and temporal scales
* Single neuron models - the circuit analogy
* Channels, synapses, and time scale separation
* Single neuron models - integrate-and-fire models
* Mean-field limits are hard - McKean-Vlasov formalism
* Mean-field (phenomenological). Review models

# Discuss patterns in nature
# Neural fields
# Steady state solutions, stability of a steady state.
# Bump formation a-la-Amari - on the board
# Announce Turing-like bifurcation (this will be done later in the tutorial)

# Bumps and waves in integrate-and-fire models (40 minutes)
* Deliver talk on bumps in integrate-and-fire systems.

# Part 2

* Recap from tutorial - discuss FFTs. Show numerical bifurcation analysis of neural
fields

* Introduce heuristic schemes for neural fields. Review Paris talk
* On-the-board examples

# Part 3
* Motivate talk as one of Francesca's talks.
* On the board: work with a simple ODE
* Introduce Francesca's work
